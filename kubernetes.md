**1.i have 4 clusters A,B,C,D and i'm in Ath cluster and i want to switch to B cluster  
Answer:**   Switching to a different cluster in Kubernetes involves changing your kubectl context to the context associated with the desired cluster,check the available contexts and their associated clusters "kubectl config get-contexts" To switch to cluster B, use the" kubectl config use-context cluster-b"command and specify the context associated with cluster B.   
**2. In kubernetes, Role based authentication    
Answer:** Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.  The RBAC API declares four kinds of Kubernetes object: Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding.

**9.what is init container and side-car container?can you give simple scenario where we use these conatiners?   
Answer**Init-containers are used to initialize something inside your Pod. The init-containers will run and exit. After every init container which exits with a code 0, your main containers will start. 
Kubernetes itself does not know anything about sidecars. Sidecar-Containers are a pattern to solve some use-cases. Usually, Kubernetes distinguishes between Init-Containers and Containers running inside your Pod.   
Typically, we call Sidecars all containers, that do not provide a user-focused service. For example, this could be a proxy or something for easier database access. If you're running a Java-App you could use a sidecar to export JVM metrics in Prometheus format.   
The difference here is, that your sidecar-containers must run all the time. If one of your not-init-containers exits, kubernetes will restart the whole pod.
And that's the difference.   
Init containers run and exit before your main application starts   
Sidecars run side-by-side with your main container(s) and provide some kind of service for them.      

**10.command to check the container logs in pod?   
Answer**$ kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>   
 we can use the â€“tail option to fetch only the latest logs.   
 $ kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> --tail=<number-of-lines>

**15.What are stateful sets in kuberentes?   
Answer**StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. 
Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of its Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. 

**16.Why config maps are used   
Answer**A configMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as env variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.A configMap allows you to decouple env specific configuration from our containers images, so that our
applications are easily portable.   
Note: It doesn't provide secrecy or encryption.
