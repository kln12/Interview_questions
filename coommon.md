1.Tell me about yourseld and previous projects   
**2.What are the challenge you have faced   
Answer** Integration Challenges:Challenge: Integration issues between different tools and components can impede the smooth flow of automation.
Strategy: Address integration challenges by ensuring that selected tools have compatible interfaces and APIs. Develop standardized data formats for information exchange between tools. Regularly test integrations and update them as the toolchain evolves.    
Integrating an Amazon EKS cluster into an existing infrastructure or toolchain can present challenges due to the inherent complexity of Kubernetes environments and the need for seamless collaboration between different component   
**3.why you changed the company without offer  
Answer:** I transitioned to explore new opportunities that aligned better with my career goals and allowed me to further develop my skills. While I didn't have a formal offer at the time,   
While I didn't have another job offer secured at the time of my resignation, I made the decision to leave my previous role because I was eager to explore new opportunities and challenges. I believed that taking this step was crucial for my long-term career development. Although I didn't secure a new position immediately, I used the time to [mention any relevant activities such as networking, skill development, or personal projects] to enhance my skills and stay engaged within my industry. I am confident that the experiences gained during this period have positioned me well for this opportunity with your company."

**6.How the deployents move from one env to other env
Answer**Moving deployments from one environment to another, such as from a development environment to a testing or production environment, typically involves a combination of tools and processes. In your case, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes are commonly used tools     
1. Version Control System (VCS):   
Ensure that your application code, configurations, and deployment scripts are version-controlled using a VCS like Git. This ensures consistency and traceability across environments.   
2. Build Process (Jenkins):   
Use Jenkins to automate your build process. Jenkins can pull the latest code from your VCS, build the application, and create a deployable artifact. This artifact could be a Docker image or any other package that encapsulates your application and its dependencies.   
3. Dockerization:   
Dockerize your application to create a containerized image. This allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a single unit that can be easily moved between different environments.   
4. Registry:   
Push your Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or a private registry. This centralizes the storage of your container images and allows for easy retrieval in different environments.   
5. Kubernetes Deployment:   
Use Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) to define your application's deployment, services, and configurations. These files specify how your application should run in a Kubernetes cluster. You can use tools like Helm to manage and template Kubernetes manifests.   
6. Environment-specific Configurations:     
Manage environment-specific configurations separately. Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets are useful for handling configuration data. Jenkins can inject environment-specific variables during the deployment process.   
7. Continuous Deployment (CD):   
Implement continuous deployment pipelines in Jenkins to automate the deployment process. Define different stages for each environment (e.g., dev, test, prod), and trigger deployments based on successful builds or manual approvals.
