**9.Need to identify ip addresses in log file and count of ip addresses in log file?   
Answer**grep -E -o "([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" logfile.txt | sort | uniq -c  
-E enables extended regular expressions.  -o prints only the matched part of the line. 
sort sorts the IP addresses.  uniq -c counts the occurrences of each unique IP address.

**12How to indentify the number of params that has been sent to shell script?   
Answer**In a shell script, you can identify the number of parameters (also known as arguments) that have been passed to the script or a function using the special variable $#. This variable stores the count of the positional parameters, which are the arguments supplied to the script or function when it is called.  
Here's how you can use $# to determine the number of parameters  
**#!/bin/bash

 Check the number of parameters
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "No parameters provided."
elif [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "One parameter provided."
else
  echo "Number of parameters provided: $#"
fi**    
In this example, we use an if-else statement to check the value of $#. If it's equal to 0, we display a message indicating that no parameters were provided. If it's equal to 1, we indicate that one parameter was provided. Otherwise, we print the actual count of parameters.  

You can run the script with different numbers of parameters to see how it responds:  
**$ ./script.sh         # No parameters provided.
$ ./script.sh param1  # One parameter provided.
$ ./script.sh p1 p2   # Number of parameters provided: 2**
You can access individual parameters within the script using $1, $2, and so on, where $1 refers to the first parameter, $2 to the second, and so forth.

**13.is it possible to store a commands output, either success or failure to the same file?   
Answer**Yes, it is possible to store both the success and failure outputs of a command in the same file in a shell script. You can achieve this by redirecting the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the same file. In Unix-like operating systems, you can do this using the 2>&1 syntax. Here's an example:    
 Run a command and store both success and failure outputs in the same file  
**command_name > output.log 2>&1**   
In this example, command_name is the command you want to run, and output.log is the name of the file where you want to store the combined output. The > operator is used to redirect stdout to output.log, and 2>&1 is used to redirect stderr (file descriptor 2) to the same location as stdout (file descriptor 1), which effectively combines both streams into a single file.  
If you want to append the output to an existing file rather than overwriting it, you can use >> instead of >:
 Append both success and failure outputs to an existing file    
**command_name >> output.log 2>&1**  
This way, you can capture both success and error messages generated by the command in a single file, making it easier to review and analyze the command's output  .   
**14.In shell script can we supply parameters to functions?   
Answer**Yes, in a shell script, you can supply parameters (also known as arguments) to functions. Functions in shell scripts are defined with the function_name() { ... } syntax, and you can pass arguments to them just like you would with a regular command or script.   
#!/bin/bash   
 Define a function with parameters     
my_function() {   
  echo "Hello, $1 and $2!"
}

 Call the function with arguments  
my_function "Alice" "Bob"   
n this example, the my_function function takes two parameters, and when you call it with "Alice" and "Bob", it prints "Hello, Alice and Bob!" to the standard output. You can access these parameters within the function using $1, $2, and so on, to refer to the first, second, and subsequent arguments passed to the function.   
$ chmod +x myscript.sh   
$ ./myscript.sh
