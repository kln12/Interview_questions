**13.is it possible to store a commands output, either success or failure to the same file?   
Answer**Yes, it is possible to store both the success and failure outputs of a command in the same file in a shell script. You can achieve this by redirecting the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the same file. In Unix-like operating systems, you can do this using the 2>&1 syntax. Here's an example:

bash
Copy code
 Run a command and store both success and failure outputs in the same file
command_name > output.log 2>&1
In this example, command_name is the command you want to run, and output.log is the name of the file where you want to store the combined output. The > operator is used to redirect stdout to output.log, and 2>&1 is used to redirect stderr (file descriptor 2) to the same location as stdout (file descriptor 1), which effectively combines both streams into a single file.

If you want to append the output to an existing file rather than overwriting it, you can use >> instead of >:

bash
Copy code
 Append both success and failure outputs to an existing file
command_name >> output.log 2>&1
This way, you can capture both success and error messages generated by the command in a single file, making it easier to review and analyze the command's output.   
**14.In shell script can we supply parameters to functions?   
Answer**Yes, in a shell script, you can supply parameters (also known as arguments) to functions. Functions in shell scripts are defined with the function_name() { ... } syntax, and you can pass arguments to them just like you would with a regular command or script.   
#!/bin/bash   
# Define a function with parameters   
my_function() {   
  echo "Hello, $1 and $2!"
}

# Call the function with arguments
my_function "Alice" "Bob"   
n this example, the my_function function takes two parameters, and when you call it with "Alice" and "Bob", it prints "Hello, Alice and Bob!" to the standard output. You can access these parameters within the function using $1, $2, and so on, to refer to the first, second, and subsequent arguments passed to the function.   
$ chmod +x myscript.sh   
$ ./myscript.sh
